# pet_recognition
This project predicts the pet based on the dataset we provide, whether it is a cat or a dog! the whole project had a huge data base which is present on keggle named dogs vs cats and it has about 26000+ pictures to train upon, moreover all the libraries have to properly installed, error is thrown mostly by not importing lib properly, this project took me about 10 hours mainly because I was trying to code along and trying  to understand each and every line of the code. Lastly the data set is huge I would suggest using a smaller dataset first as it works Much much faster and better
